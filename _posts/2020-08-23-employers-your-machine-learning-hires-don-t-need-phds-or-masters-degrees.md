Asking Machine Learning/AI hires to have fancy degrees is outdated. Here's why.

<!--more-->

Should your machine learning hire have a PhD? Do you need a PhD to work in ML?

I see PhD and Masters degrees listed as requirements in ML job descriptions so often, which is a really unusual ask for engineers. We don't ask this of developers working on networking or security or systems architecture or app development. What makes machine learning so special?

Some might say it's because ML is uniquely complex and math-y. That may be true, but so is cryptography and distributed systems and lots of other topics in Computer Science. I think it's something else:

Machine learning is **really new** for most of us in tech. Just five years ago, my colleagues were still talking about deep learning as a dubious bet. Tools were difficult to use. Beefy hardware designed for ML was hard to get. Model quality was far from where it is today.

In 2015, Princeton, my alma matter, offered only around \~3 ML/AI classes. Machine Learning was definitely not a "standard" part of your typical Computer Science curriculum, and you could easily graduate without learning anything about it. No wonder so many people go back to school to fill in this suddenly relevant hole in their CS educations.

It should be no surprise, then, that so many engineers who _actually_ work on deployed ML today have no background in the field. They learned on the job. Even at Google, one of the world's largest employers of ML researchers, tons of engineers who work on AI products have no prior experience with the technology. They learn through online resources, internal courses (like Google's [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)), or by taking on small chunks of projects and learning as they go.

What's more, it's _much, MUCH_ easier to learn machine learning outside of the classroom today than it was 5 years ago. Our tools have become significantly [more user-friendly](https://daleonai.com/software-developers-youre-learning-machine-learning-upside-down) (PyTorch, TensorFlow 2.0, Keras, to name a few). Paired with an enormous and growing ecosystem of online resources, you can give yourself quite a hefty ML education without ever spending a dime.

So we have a disconnect: though we require PhDs and Masters degrees when we hire machine learning candidates, most engineers actually working on the stuff don't have those credentials. Plus, many able engineers are giving themselves fine ML educations on their own through free resources. That should give hope both to employers--who can expand their hiring pool--and to would-be employees, who don't need an extra degree to succeed in ML.

But if you drop the extra degree requirement from your machine learning job description, how do you know when you've got a high-quality, able candidate? This question doesn't have an easy answer, but it's not new. Most smart recruiters in tech have dropped the notion that having a degree means someone is a good software engineer or that lacking one means they're bad. Instead of looking at credentials, we spend more time building effective interviews that allow candidates to show off their skills no-matter how or where they learned them. And now we need to do the same for Machine Learning.
