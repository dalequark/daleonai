Embeddings are one of the most versatile techniques in machine learning, and a critical tool every ML engineer should have in their tool belt. It‚Äôs a shame, then, that so few of us understand what they are and what they‚Äôre good for!

The problem, maybe, is that embeddings sound slightly abstract and esoteric:

*In machine learning, an embedding is a way of representing data as points in n-dimensional space so that similar data points cluster together.*

Sound boring and unimpressive? Don‚Äôt be fooled. Because once you understand this ML multitool, you‚Äôll be able to build everything from search engines to recommendation systems to chatbots, and a whole lot more. Plus, you don‚Äôt have to be a data scientist with ML expertise to use them, nor do you need a huge labeled dataset.

Have I convinced you how neat these bad boys are? ü§û

Good. Let‚Äôs dive in. In this post, we‚Äôll explore:

* What embeddings are
* What they‚Äôre used for
* Where and how to find open-source embedding models
* How to use them
* How to build your own embeddings

## What can you build with embeddings?

Before we talk about what embeddings are, let‚Äôs take quick stock of what you can build with them.

1. Recommendation systems (i.e. Netflix-style if-you-like-these-movies-you‚Äôll-like-this-one-too)
2. All kinds of search
3. 1. Text search (like Google Search)
   2. Image search (like Google search-by-image)
4. Chatbots and question-answering systems
5. Data preprocessing (preparing data to be fed into a machine learning model)
6. One-shot/zero-shot learning (i.e. machine learning models that learn from almost no training data)
7. Fraud detection/outlier detection
8. Typo detection and all manners of ‚Äúfuzzy matching‚Äù
9. Detecting when ML models go stale (drift)
10. So much more!

Even if you‚Äôre not trying to do something on this list, the applications of embeddings is so broad that you should probably keep reading, just in case.
