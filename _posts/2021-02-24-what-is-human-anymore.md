\- Quote about GEB guy: music was the last thing that's human

\- We used to think that computers could only do things that were logical. In AI, this was called symbolic systems.

\- Today, thanks to neural networks--a type of subsymbolic system--we're able to do the opposite. "Bad at math, good at tennis."

\- If you work in AI, you've undoubtedly experienced this. I had that experience both with style transfer and GPT-3 and DALLEE

\- I think it's for this reasons people draw a line and say, well, what do humans have left?

\- But it's a trap. Because all that data comes from the internet.

\- It's like a mirror, mismatched and rearranged.

\- Understanding this, we can start to ask what types of problems won't be able to be solved by neural networks do to a lack of data.

\- However, humans parody TV and movies too.
