_Turn your local computer into a listening, talking Voice User Interface powered by Dialogflow._

If you’ve worked with [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) (DF) before, you know it’s a quick way to build smart conversational interfaces. A Dialogflow [Agent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-overview) can be the brains behind a Facebook Messenger or Slack chatbot, a Google Assistant or Alexa app, or even an automated customer service agent.

<!--more-->

Out of the box, Dialogflow comes with a handful of supported integrations that make deploying a DF app on Slack/Facebook/Alexa/etc a snap.

But sometimes, rather than integrate your agent into an existing platform, you want to run it on your own device. Maybe you’re building a self-help kiosk and want to talk to Dialogflow directly from your localMac/PC/Raspberry Pi.

In this post, I’ll show you how to do just that, by connecting to a Dialogflow Agent in Node.js, streaming audio in from your computer’s microphone, and streaming your DialogFlow agent’s responses out through your speaker. (If you don’t use Node, check out a Python code sample [here](https://gist.github.com/dalequark/aa0385de55b97fe1e2950b6e1ead063c).) All you’ll need to get started is an existing DF agent. Meanwhile, if you want to skip directly to the code, you can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/dalequark/4648c110b02963a049da2bfa637493fb).

Let’s get started 👉

Configuring Dialogflow to Speak
===============================

First, log in to the [Dialogflow console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/login) and navigate to the project you’d like to stream with. In my case, I’m working with a project called `SimpleAlarm`.

Click the gear icon in the upper left corner of the screen.

{% include image_caption.html imageurl="/images/2020-02-06-streaming-dialogflow-on-your-desktop-device-raspberry-pi/2" title="Here, under the General tab, note your project id (mine is `simplealarm-spoitm`).

Authentication
--------------

Since we want to interact with our Dialogflow Agent in Node.js from our local computer, we’ll need to set up authentication. Across Google Cloud, authentication is handled through [service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts), which we’ll set up now.

First, navigate to the GCP [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (now’s a good time to mention you’ll need to have a Google Cloud account and login). Navigate to the GCP project whose project id corresponds to the project id of your Dialogflow Agent (remember we took note of that in the last step?).

In the left hand bar, go to IAM & admin -> Service accounts.

{% include image_caption.html imageurl="/images/2020-02-06-streaming-dialogflow-on-your-desktop-device-raspberry-pi/6" title="Click “+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT” at the top of the screen." caption="Click “+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT” at the top of the screen." %}

Anyone with this file will be able to access your Dialogflow Agent, so keep this a secret and don’t check it in to any GitHub repos!" %}



Meanwhile, create a new folder for this project (i.e. `dialogflow_streaming_agent`) and move the credentials `json` file to that folder.

Writing Node.js Dialogflow Streaming Code
=========================================

Dependencies
------------

To get started, you’ll need to download some dependencies. For this project, I used the package [node-record-lpcm16](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-record-lpcm16) to record audio from my microphone and the package [node-speaker](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-speaker) to play audio responses from Dialogflow through my speaker. You can use other speaker and microphone libraries, but I found these consistently worked on both my MacBook and on the Pi.

To install `node-record-lpcm16`, you may need to install some dependencies, like `sox`, first. See the docs [here](https://github.com/gillesdemey/node-record-lpcm16), but on a Mac, you’ll probably want to do something like:

```
brew install sox  
npm install node-record-lpcm16
```

On Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all  
npm install node-record-lpcm16
```

To install `node-speaker`:

```
npm install speaker
```

Or on Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev  
npm install speaker
```

On my Mac, I noticed I kept getting the error `Illegal Instruction: 4` when using this library. The solution was to install `speaker` with this flag:

```
npm install speaker --mpg123-backend=openal
```

Finally:

```
npm install pump dotenv dialogflow-v2
```

Understanding the Dialogflow Streaming Interface
------------------------------------------------

**Dialogflow Streaming Configuration**

If you poke around the Dialogflow documentation, you’ll see there is a sample code page called [Detect Intent with Audio Stream Input](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/detect-intent-stream#detect-intent-stream-nodejs). This snippet shows you how to stream audio to and from _files_. But in this post, rather than stream from files, we want to collect audio directly from the microphone and play it directly out of the speaker. I’ll walk you through how to do this step by step, but the completed code sample is [here](https://gist.github.com/dalequark/4648c110b02963a049da2bfa637493fb).

To get started with the Dialogflow streaming interface, import the library and create a new client:

```
const dialogflow = require('dialogflow');const sessionClient = new dialogflow.SessionsClient();
```

In this streaming setup, we’ll collect audio from the microphone and continually send it to the `sessionClient`. But before we send audio, the first data packet we’ll need to send to Dialogflow is a configuration object. I’ve packaged this step up in a function I’ve called `makeInitialStreamRequestArgs`:

```
function makeInitialStreamRequestArgs(projectId, sessionId) {  
    // Initial request for Dialogflow setup  
          
    const sessionPath = sessionClient.sessionPath(projectId, sessionId);  
          
    return {              
        session: sessionPath,              
        queryInput: {                  
            audioConfig: {                      
                audioEncoding: "LINEAR16",  
                sampleRateHertz: 16000,  
                languageCode: "en-US",  
            },                  
            singleUtterance: true,              
         },              
         outputAudioConfig: {                  
             audioEncoding: \`OUTPUT\_AUDIO\_ENCODING\_LINEAR\_16\`,  
             sampleRateHertz: 16000,              
         },          
    };      
}
```

Let’s talk about these configuration parameters.

First, `makeInitialStreamRequestArgs` takes two parameters, `projectId` and `sessionId`. `projectId` is your GCP project ID, which we collected from the Dialogflow console up above (in my case, it was `simplealarm-spoitm`). `sessionId`, on the other hand, is an id that you, the caller, create for each user _session_. You’ll send this sessionId along with every call you make to Dialogflow to indicate you’re continuing an ongoing conversation.

These two parameters, `projectId` and `sessionId`, are used together to create a `sessionPath` variable which is sent along with the initial configuration.

You’ll notice in the code above a `json` field called `queryInput`, which tells Dialogflow what type of input audio data to expect. We set`audioEncoding: "LINEAR16"` to indicate we’re sending audio from our microphone in “16-bit linear pulse-code modulation (PCM) encoding”. This field can also be `"MP3"`, `"FLAC"`, or a handful of other encoding types listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/encoding). For raw data from a microphone, you’ll usually want to use `"LINEAR16"`. `sampleRateHertz: 16000` indicates we’ll send Dialogflow audio that’s sampled at 1600 Hertz. You can determine the sampling rate of your microphone on Linux using the command:

```
arecord --list-devices
```

However, I found that using an alternate sampling rate here doesn’t break anything 🤞.

In `queryInput`, we’ll set the field `singleUtterance: true`. From the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/detect-intent-stream):

*   If `false` (default), speech recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream.
*   If `true`, Dialogflow will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. When Dialogflow detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused, it ceases speech recognition and sends a `StreamingDetectIntentResponse` with a recognition result of `END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE` to your client. Any audio sent to Dialogflow on the stream after receipt of `END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE` is ignored by Dialogflow.

Setting this field to `true` conveniently means that Dialogflow will automatically detect when the user has stopped speaking, allowing it to handle the logic of when to stop listening and start speaking its response.

Finally, `outputAudioConfig` tells Dialogflow what type of audio we’d like to receive, which we will then play through the speaker.

**Connecting Dialogflow to the Microphone**

To begin collecting audio and detecting intents, let’s create a new function, `getAudio(sessionId)`, which will handle creating a Dialogflow Stream, creating a microphone Stream, setting up configuration, and detecting intents. `getAudio` will return a [Javascript Promise](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) which resolves when it’s a received an audio response from the Dialogflow (more details on that below).

First, create a new Dialogflow intent detection stream, like so:

```
function getAudio(sessionId, projectId) { const detectStream = this.sessionClient.streamingDetectIntent()            .on('error', console.error);
```

Next, we’ll send the Dialogflow configuration packet using the function we wrote in the last step:

```
detectStream.write(makeInitialStreamRequestArgs(projectId, sessionId));
```

Now we’ll begin collecting audio from the microphone and streaming it to the `detectStream` object.

To create a microphone stream, we’ll create a new `record` object using the library `node-record-lpcm16` we installed before:

```
const recording = record.record({  
    sampleRateHertz: 16000,                  
    threshold: 0,                  
    verbose: false,                  
    recordProgram: 'arecord', // Try also "arecord" or "sox"  
    silence: '10.0',              
});              
const recordingStream = recording.stream().on('error', console.error);
```

You should set `recordProgram` to whatever audio recording software is installed on your computer. On my MacBook, I use `sox`, and on Linux/Raspberry Pi, `arecord`.

To connect the recording stream (`recordingStream`) to the Dialogflow stream (`detectStream`), I used a small Javascript library called [pump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pump). This lets us do a small transform on the data coming out of the `recordingStream` so it’s in the format `detectStream` expects.

```
const pumpStream = pump(recordingStream,              
    // Format the audio stream into the request format.  
    new Transform({objectMode: true,  
    transform: (obj, \_, next) => {  
        next(null, { inputAudio: obj });  
    },}),              
    detectStream);
```

**Streaming Audio and Detecting Intents**

Now that we’re streaming audio data to the cloud, Dialogflow can listen and — when it detects that the user is done speaking — try to match the user’s [Intent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/intents-overview) and return a response.

Let’s take a look:

Streaming microphone data to Dialogflow and listening for Dialogflow’s responses

There’s a lot going on [here](http://baby-name-gen.firebaseapp.com), so let’s break it down.

`detectStream.on('data'` is a handler for listening to `data` events emitted by Dialogflow. Dialogflow emits `data` events to convey [lost of different types of information](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dialogflow.v2#google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentResponse):

```
{ responseId: '',  
  recognitionResult: null,  
  queryResult:  
   { fulfillmentMessages: \[\],  
     outputContexts: \[\],  
     queryText: '',  
     speechRecognitionConfidence: 0,  
     action: '',  
     parameters: null,  
     allRequiredParamsPresent: false,  
     fulfillmentText: '',  
     webhookSource: '',  
     webhookPayload: null,  
     intent: null,  
     intentDetectionConfidence: 0,  
     diagnosticInfo: null,  
     languageCode: 'en-US',  
     sentimentAnalysisResult: null },  
  webhookStatus: null,  
  outputAudio: <Buffer >,  
  outputAudioConfig: null }
```

For example, as the user speaks, Dialogflow will fire a `data` event with the parameter `data.recognitionResult` set, which contains a real-time transcript of what it thinks the user is saying. For example, if I say, into the microphone, “What’s the weather today?” Dialogflow might emit several `data` events with `recognitionResult.transcript` containing, respectively:

```
“What’s”  
“What’s the”  
“What’s the heather” // NOTE: heather changed later to "weather"  
“What’s the weather today?”
```

Note that sometimes (as in the example above), the transcription may change as the user speaks more words and provides more context.

When the user stops speaking, Dialogflow will emit a packet with the field `data.recognitionResult.isFinal` set to `true`. At this point, you’ll **need** **close the microphone:**

```
if (data.recognitionResult.isFinal) {             
   console.log("Result Is Final");                      
   recording.stop();                      
}
```

When the user stops speaking, Dialogflow will begin matching what the user said to an Intent. It will then emit a data event with the field`data.queryResult` filled. `data.queryResult.fulfillmentText` will contain a text version of Dialogflow’s reply (i.e. “The weather today is cloudy”). `queryResult` also contains [other useful fields](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dialogflow.v2#queryresult), like `queryResult.intent.displayName` (the name of the matched intent) and `queryResult.parameters` for matched parameters.

Finally, the last `data` event Dialogflow emits will contain an audio response, `data.outputAudio`. At this point, in the code above, we close the pump (`pumpStream.end`) and resolve the Promise, return the audio and the `queryResult`:

```
resolve({“audio” : data.outputAudio, “queryResult” : queryResult});
```

By the way, if it’s unclear how this all fits together, check out the [complete code sample](https://gist.github.com/dalequark/4648c110b02963a049da2bfa637493fb) (so far we’ve been talking about the `getAudio` function).

Congratulations! You’ve set up the hardest part of streaming with Dialogflow.

**Playing Dialogflow’s Audio Responses through the Speaker**

After the user speaks a request to our agent and we receive its audio response, we’ll need to play that response through our computer’s speaker using the `node-speaker` library. We’ll do that in a function called `playAudio`:

```
playAudio(audioBuffer) {          
    return new Promise(resolve => {              
        // Setup the speaker for playing audio              
        const speaker = new Speaker({                  
            channels: 1,                  
            bitDepth: 16,                  
            sampleRate: 16000,              
        });                          
        speaker.on("close", () => {                  
            resolve();              
        });                  
        // Setup the audio stream, feed the audio buffer in     
        const audioStream = new PassThrough();  
        audioStream.pipe(speaker);  
        audioStream.end(audioBuffer);          
    })      
}
```

Because playing audio through the speaker is an asynchronous operation, `playAudio` returns a Promise that resolves when `audioBuffer` is done playing. Here, in the configuration for `Speaker`, `sampleRate` should be the same sample rate as the value we passed in `outputAudioConfig` when we configured our Dialogflow stream (in this case, 16000).

Now you have a function that plays audio through the speaker!

**Putting it All Together**

Now that we’ve written code for getting and playing audio, let’s weave them together in a “listen-play-listen-play-listen…” loop. In other words, we’ll design a new function that listens to the user, waits for them to stop speaking, speaks a responds, and begins listening again, just like a real (polite) human being.

Write a new function, `stream`, like this:

```
async function stream() {  
   console.log('Listening, press Ctrl+C to stop.');     
   // Create a new id for this session      
   const sessionId = uuidv1();          
         
   while (true) {          
       const res = await getAudio(sessionId, YOUR\_PROJECT\_ID);       
       if (res\["queryResult"\]) {  
           console.log("Got query result ", res\["queryResult"\]);        
       }          
       if (res\["audio"\]) {  
           await stream.playAudio(res\["audio"\]);          
       }  
}}
```

This asynchronous function `stream` creates a new session by generating a random session id. Then it creates a loop that collects data from the microphone, listens for an audio response from Dialogflow, and plays it back through the speaker. It does this in a `while(true)` loop, i.e. forever.

Now, if you make a call to `stream()` at the end of your Javascript file, you’re good to go! Or you can of course just download and run [my code](https://gist.github.com/dalequark/4648c110b02963a049da2bfa637493fb). (Apologies that it doesn’t _exactly_ line up with these inline samples, but they’re pretty close).

You’re Done!
