<h3 style="margin-top: -1.15em;">Applied AI Engineer @ Google Cloud. Writer, Coder, Maker, Napper.</h3>

Making things is fun. Debugging TensorFlow models isn’t. (Usually.) Relearning Linear Algebra is definitely a party, but who has time for that?

New technology should inspire—not intimidate. At Google Cloud, I build tools to make Machine Learning simpler for software developers. On the internet, I share the things I build.

I got my start in tech as an undergrad at Princeton, where I studied Computer Science. I graduated just as Machine Learning was become a “thing.” 

In New York, I worked as a software engineer and data scientist at the online dating site OkCupid, where we used math to find people love. (Or something like that.)  

After that, I worked as a software engineer at Google Research and Google Cloud.

I’ve spoken at conferences like Google Cloud NEXT and [Google I/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrMtF_inTZ0), and have been published in The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Gizmodo, and more. Keep up with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dalequark).
