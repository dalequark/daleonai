<h3 style="margin-top: -1.15em;">Generative AI Developer Advocacy Lead @ Google Labs. Writer, Coder, Maker, Napper.</h3

I lead Generative AI advocacy and education at Google, focusing on Large Language Models. I help design tools to make LLM development easier, build prototypes, and teach developers internally and externally how to build apps with LLMs.

Before I worked in Labs, I worked in Google Cloud, helping people in all sorts of industries understand how machine learning can solve problems.

I also write a lot of open-source [code](https://github.com/google/making_with_ml) and host the YouTube show [Making With Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqLsaG5hNms0D9aZRBE7DHBb).

Before this gig, I worked in Google Research on Natural Language Processing for [Google News](https://news.google.com/topstories?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en). And before that, I worked as a software engineer and data scientist at the online dating site OkCupid, where we used math to find people love. I'll always have a soft spot for that job, because it's where I met *my* love. But also, it also [scarred me for life](https://logicmag.io/failure/the-servers-are-burning/).

Before OkCupid, I studied Computer Science at Princeton.

Sometimes I speak at events, like Google Cloud NEXT and [Google I/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrMtF_inTZ0). I've written for The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Gizmodo, The Next Web, and more.
