H﻿i! My name is Dale and I'm an engineer and writer.

My writing has been published in [Nautilus](https://nautil.us/how-the-occult-gave-birth-to-science-1041122/), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/hopping-on-a-plane-for-a-first-date/553322/), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2017/09/29/hinges-ceo-says-vulnerability-not-an-algorithm-is-the-key-to-a-good-dating-app/), [New York Magazine](https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/banned-from-okcupid-sexting-moderation.html), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/the-future-of-online-dating-is-unsexy-and-brutally-effe-1819781116), and beyond. I’m currently writing (and seeking representation for) two novels, including one inspired by the [occult origins of science](https://nautil.us/how-the-occult-gave-birth-to-science-1041122/).

For almost a decade, I worked in AI and NLP, most recently as the Generative AI advocacy and education lead at Google. There, I penned [code](https://github.com/google/making_with_ml), hosted the YouTube series [Making With Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqLsaG5hNms0D9aZRBE7DHBb), and wrote about AI. I had the pleasure of teaching [Lupe Fiasco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYp18JAvKkQ) how to use LLMs, hacking together an MVP of [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), and bringing the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api) into the world. Before that, I worked in Google Research on Natural Language Processing for [Google News](https://news.google.com/topstories?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en). And before that, I worked as a software engineer at the online dating site OkCupid, where we used math to find people love. I'll always have a soft spot for that job, because it's where I met *my* love. But also, it also [scarred me for life](https://logicmag.io/failure/the-servers-are-burning/).

Before OkCupid, I studied Computer Science at Princeton.
