In my humble opinion, one of the most under-hyped, user-friendly, useful tools in machine learning is embeddings--specifically text embeddings. We'll get deep dive into what embeddings are in a bit, but in brief: text embeddings let you take words (or phrases and sentences) and tell how similar they are. You can use this technique to find synonyms (i.e. "grandma" and "grand mom" and "bubby"), to do basic [translation](https://ai.stanford.edu/\~wzou/emnlp2013_ZouSocherCerManning.pdf), to cluster similar issues in your customer service queue, to power chatbot logic, to make video game worlds [come alive](https://stadia.dev/intl/fr_ca/blog/creating-game-ai-using-mostly-english/), and a whole lot more.

But perhaps the most exciting thing about embeddings is that you won't want to kill yourself learning how to use them. In this post, I'll show you how to use spreadsheets and pre-trained models to prototype a "Semantic ML"-powered app (no data science experience required). And, if you want to see how this tech can make video game worlds more interactive, check out [my latest interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZEXwk_f7Tk) with Anna Kipnis--former Double Fine game developer and Stadia Creative Technologist--who is using the same technology to transform the ways we develop video games.

Let's get started.
