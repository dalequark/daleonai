  Serves and Penalty Kicks
description: In this post, well use Machine Learning to analyze key features athletes
  need to know, like their posture, angles of their bodies, and the speed or power
  of their throws.

Ah, _sportsball_. Can you ever forget the first time you grab that pass, fly down the court, and sink that puck right through the net as your fans yell adoringly from the bleachers, _TOUCHDOWN!_

No? Not ringing a bell? Me neither. That's what you get when you spend your high school years learning calculus and icing pi on cookie cakes instead of doing sports.

_How many friends do you think this made me?_

You never get that time back.

The dream, of course, is to use all that math and physics knowledge to actually look cool. “From small time Mathlete to big time Athlete,” as Michelle Trachtenberg shows us in the iconic 2005 Disney movie “Ice Princess.”

For someone as uncoordinated as I am, using AI to get better at sports is the dream. But can it be done?

Machine Learning already plays a role in sports, as companies [use it to](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/technology/ai-sports-athletes-machine-learning.html) identify players’ unique talents, detect injuries earlier, and broker optimal player trades. Plus, almost every professional sport (NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA, soccer, golf, cricket, to name a few) uses ML technology for tracking. The NBA, for example, has deployed a sophisticated vision-based system all on courts, tracking players’ motions, reading numbers off their jerseys, analyzing how fast they pass the ball, and determining how accurately they shoot under pressure.

But it’s easy to imagine that technology could be adapted to beginners too, telling us, in real time, where we’re making mistakes.

In this post, we’ll take a look at how you might do just that, using accessible ML tools.
