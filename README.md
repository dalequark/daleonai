# Dale on AI

This is the personal blog of Dale Markowitz, where she writes about Machine Learning for developers, AI in the world, and a whole lot more.

## Development

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). To run it locally, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This will start a local server, and you can view the site at `http://localhost:8080`.

3.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a production-ready build in the `_site` directory.
